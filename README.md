# DIY_Ardugirl
A SAMD21-based riff on the Arduboy handheld console. This is definitely Work in Progress and is not for production

The original has:
- ATmega32u4 processor 
- small OLED screen
- no additional storage
- speaker

This will have
- SAMD21G18A as it's processor
- larger daylight readable LCD screen, with dimmable backlight
- SPI flash and micro SD card slot (overkill - the latter may not be populated)
- headphone jack
- infrared rx/tx for possible multiplayer comms
- optional mini joystick
